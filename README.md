# journal

A program that models a journal, enabling users to create journal entries, which have a title, body, date and rating. You could use this to log good and bad days, favorite coffee shops, beverages, anime episodes, pair-programming dates - you get the idea. Applies the concepts of navigation, forms, lists and data persistence. Enhance your application with adaptivity, dynamic theme switching, third-party packages for persistence, and encounter challenges of state management.
